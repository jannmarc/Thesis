Among the study participants, the proportion of people in the PHA group were 10.4% and of that, 5.9% were with KCHA and 4.6% with SHA. The majority, 89.5% did not have any public housing assitance in 2017. Overall, 9.9% were considered to meet the definiton of diabetes and the rest, 90.1% were not considered to have diabetes.

For the first analysis, the assocation between diabetes status and public housing assistance, in unadjusted model the odds ratio of having diabetes was 1.34 fold greater (95% CI: 1.31-1.38) for those with public housing assistance (table 2). In the adjusted model, PHA residents were 93% more likely to meet the definition of diabetes compared to those that were non-PHA residents.

Status  | Model 1          | Model 2

Non-PHA | Referent         | Referent
PHA     | 1.34 (1.31-1.38) | 1.94 (1.88-1.99)

In the second analysis, the association between diabetes status and the specific public housing authorities, the crude model showed that the odds of meeting the definiton of diabetes were 1.28 (95% CI: 1.24-1.33) times greater among KCHA residents and 1.42 (95% CI: 1.38-1.48) times greater among SHA residents. The adjusted model showed, that among KCHA residents the odds of meeting the definition of diabetes were 2.16 (95% CI: 2.09-2.25) times higher and 1.70 (95% CI: 1.64-1.77) for SHA residents compared to non-PHA residents.
