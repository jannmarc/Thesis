## Descriptive Statistics
Among King County residents on Medicaid or Medicare in 2017, 10.4% also received support from a PHA (5.9% were in KCHA and 4.6% in SHA) (See Table \@ref(tab:table1)). A greater proportion of people in the PHA population met the definition of diabetes at 12.7% compared to the non-PHA group with 9.6%. Overall, 9.9% met the definition of diabetes. Additionally, the population age distributions were different between PHA status; the non-PHA category had an older population (median of age of 62.0, mean age of 50.0 compared with the PHA population median and mean age of 34.0 and 35.7, respectively). The PHA group were more racially and ethnically diverse however, the gender distribution between the two groups were similar.

## Public Housing and Diabetes
In the primary analysis, the association between diabetes status and public housing assistance, the crude model showed that the odds ratio of having diabetes was 1.34 fold greater for those receiving public housing assistance (See Table \@ref(tab:table2)). This effect increased in the adjusted model when the potential confounders were added, PHA residents were 94% more likely to meet the definition of diabetes compared to those that were non-PHA residents (See Table \@ref(tab:table3)).

## Public Housing Authorities and Diabetes
In the secondary analysis, estimating the association between diabetes status and the specific public housing authorities, the crude model showed that the odds of meeting the definition of diabetes were 1.28 times greater among KCHA residents and 1.42 times greater among SHA residents (See Table \@ref(tab:table4)). The adjusted model revealed that among KCHA residents, the odds of meeting the definition of diabetes were 2.16 times higher and 1.70 for SHA residents compared to non-PHA residents (See Table \@ref(tab:table5)).
