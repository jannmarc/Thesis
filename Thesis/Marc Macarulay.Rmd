# Background and Significance {#rmd-basics}

## Public Housing

## Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic disease that is characterized by an inability of the body to maintain a healthy blood glucose level, this can cause a variety of symptoms that affect multiple systems in the body and can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The key regulator hormone of glucose is insulin and it is produced in the pancreas. The absence or malfunction of insulin leads to elevated blood glucose levels called hyperglycemia. When insulin hormone is missing or ineffective the disease is called Diabetes Mellitus, this condition has multiple types.

### Diabetes Variants

The most common diabetes variants include type I diabetes mellitus, type II diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes. Type I diabetes is usually caused by genetic factors triggering an autoimmune reaction that results in the destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Also known as Juvenile Diabetes, the type I classification is typically diagnosed relatively early in life during childhood or early adulthood. Whereas, Type II diabetes develops when the body can still produce insulin however the amount is insuffient or when the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin. Type II diabetes is largely attributed to lifestyle factors including obesity and physical activity levels. Gestational diabetes is the least common type and occurs during pregnancy.

Diabetes is a serious chronic disease condition without a medical cure. Medical treatment of Diabetes is centered around exogenous insulin replacement or use of medications that stimulate the pancreas to produce endogenous insulin. In the absence of adequate control, diabetes can lead to increased risk of vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, amputation of toes, feet, or legs and even premature death; all of which have financial implications.

Many families have been left devastated by some of these complications and are financially indebted because of hospital bills, cost of medications, and time off work.  For Type II Diabetics, a big part of their management is lifestyle modification which includes diet control and increased physical activity. This goal of this later method is to promote weight loss and reduce excess fat which in turn reduces insulin resistance and enhances disease control.[@Ludwig2011]

##Problem Definition

<!--chapter:end:Background.Rmd-->

# Methods {#math-sci}

## Study Setting and Study Design

The current study investigates whether public housing is asociated with risk of diabetes status among King County, WA residents who were enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. This study uses a descriptive cross-sectional design. The cross-sectional design is appropriate because it allows for an estimate of a dichotomous disease outcome at a particular point in time [@greenland].

The analysis of this study was conducted on a dataset compiled from the King County _Data Across Sectors for Housing and Health (DASHH)_ partnership. The findings from the original initial study have previously been reported [@PublicHealth-SeattleandKingCounty2018].

## Data Sources

In an effort to reduce fragmented data siloes across different sectors, the DASHH partnership was formed in 2016 between Public Health - Seattle and King County (PHSKC), and two public housing authories, King County Housing Authority (KCHA) and Seattle Housing Authority (SHA). The primary objectives for DASHH were to join health and housing administrative data together to inform and measure future interventions, relating to policy, outreach, and program evaluation that would improve the health of King County residents, as well as to disseminate actionable data with key health and housing stakeholders.

The housing data provided by both KCHA and SHA originated from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This data source contained elements that included demographic information and period of enrollment for families and individuals. Claims and enrollment for Medicaid and Medicare data were from Washington Health Care Authority (HCA) which was provided to PHSKC. Enrollment data contained information on who was recieving Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Claims data provided elements such as diagnosis codes that were used to identify acute events and chronic conditions. All these data sources were linked together by a unique identifier ID.

## Study Population

The study population were participants that were enrolled in either Medicare or Medicaid programs. Further eligibility for study participation included King County, Washington residency and at least 11 months of Medicare or Medicaid coverage in 2017. The overall number of participants derived from the DASHH dataset totaled 585,372.

### Exposure Variable

The exposure variable for this study was public housing assistance  status. This was extracted from the HUD-50058 form which was provided by the PHAs. The HUD-50058 form provides information on families that participate in public housing or Section 8 rental subsidy programs [Source]. Housing assitance is separated into 3 main types:

* Housing Choice Vouchers - vouchers provided to recipients to rent units on the private housing market
* Public housing properties and units - subisidized housing managed by PHAs
* Project-based vouchers - subsidized housing units not managed by PHAs

Responses on the HUD-50058 form were combined into a composite public housing binary variable. Study partipants that were not enrolled in any of the listed housing assistance programs were coded as 0 for PHA status. Whereas, those responses that contained any of the 3 types of housing housing assistance was given a 1 for PHA status.

### Outcome Variable

The outcome variable for this study was diabetes status.This was defined using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chonic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) algorithm [Source]. According to the CCW, a participant meets the criteria if they have at least 1 inpatient, skilled nursing facility, home health agency visit or 2 hospital outpatient or carrier claims with diabetes diagnoses codes as outlined by the chronic conditions reference list within the last 2 years[Source]. This definition does not specify diabetes variant but instead accounts for any type diabetes diagnoses. The diabetes status outcome variable was dichotomous, given a 0 or 1. Those that did not meet the CCW alogrithm were coded a 0 and those that met the criteria were coded as 1 for diabetes status.

### Potenetial Confounders

Potential confounders were identified based on literature review. This study considers age, race and ethnicity and gender as potential confounding variables. Each of these variables were selected due to the increased baseline risk for partipants to be either in public housing or have diabetes. It is known that diabetes is an age-related disease, with a higher risk for older populations [@Selvin2013]. Age was presented as a discrete variable for the partipants age in 2017. Similarly, according to CDC data, racial minority groups may be differentially at risk for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared to their white counterparts [@Divers2020 & @CDC2020]. Race and ethnicity variable was defined categorically and included: American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian, Asian Pacific Islander, Black/African American, Latino, Multiple, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Other, Unknown, and White. Finally, gender was selected because both psychosocial and biological factors are responsible for sex and gender diabetes risk differences [@Kautzky-Willer2016]. Gender was grouped categorically and included: Female, Male, and Multiple.

## Analyses

As is common in epidemiological and health services research, demographic characteristics were presented to describe the population distribition [@hayes-larson2019]. Descriptive analyses were first used to list the count and percentages for each of the demographic categorical variables. (See table 1). The demographics table is arranged by PHA status, this included: KCHA, SHA, combined PHA and non-PHA. Although the discrete variable for age was used in the statistical analyses, age was reported categorically in the descriptive analyses for a simpler layout. Mean and median age were also shown for each category.

For the statistical analyses, logistic regression models were fitted to assess the risk of diabetes status in relation to public housing assistance status. This analysis is appropriate for this study because logistic reregression analyses allows for measuring the association of an effect towards a binomial response variable by combining multiple variables to avoid confounding [@Sperandei2014]. Two models were used to determine the odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the association between public housing assistance and diabetes status. These models were the unadjusted model, without any other variables included and the adjusted model including age, race and ethnicity and gender variables. Findings were statistical significant if the estimates did not cross the the confidence intervals and p-values were the <0.05 cutoff. Analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.0.

# Results {#ref-labels}






















#

By far the easiest way to present tables in your thesis is to store the contents of the table in a CSV or Excel file, then read that file in to your R Markdown document as a data frame. Then you can style the table with the `kable` function, or functions in the [kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/index.html) pacakge.

In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a data frame in **R** that you saw in [R Markdown Basics] using the `kable` function, you can also create tables using _pandoc_. (More information is available at <http://pandoc.org/README.html#tables>.)  This might be useful if you don't have values specifically stored in **R**, but you'd like to display them in table form.  Below is an example.  Pay careful attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows and columns. Generally I don't recommend this approach of typing the table directly into your R Markdown document.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Factors                    Correlation between Parents & Child      Inherited
------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------
  Education                                -0.49                         Yes

  Socio-Economic Status                     0.28                        Slight   

  Income                                    0.08                          No

  Family Size                               0.18                        Slight

  Occupational Prestige                     0.21                        Slight
------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------
Table: (\#tab:inher) Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents and Child

We can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table \@ref(tab:inher).  If you go back to [Loading and exploring data] and look at the `kable` table, we can create a reference to this max delays table too: Table \@ref(tab:maxdelays). The addition of the `(\#tab:inher)` option to the end of the table caption allows us to then make a reference to Table `\@ref(tab:label)`. Note that this reference could appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared.  

<!-- We will next explore ways to create this label-ref link using figures. -->

\clearpage

<!-- clearpage ends the page, and also dumps out all floats.
  Floats are things like tables and figures. -->


## Figures

If your thesis has a lot of figures, _R Markdown_ might behave better for you than that other word processor. One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You'll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier.  If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and _R Markdown_ will automatically adjust the numbering for you.  No need for you to remember!  So that you don't have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple **R** functions have been created for you to assist.  You'll see their use below.

<!--
One thing that may be annoying is the way _R Markdown_ handles "floats" like tables and figures (it's really \LaTeX's fault). \LaTeX\ will try to find the best place to put your object based on the text around it and until you're really, truly done writing you should just leave it where it lies. There are some optional arguments specified in the options parameter of the `label` function.  If you need to shift your figure around, it might be good to look here on tweaking the options argument:  <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions>

If you need a graphic or tabular material to be part of the text, you can just put it inline. If you need it to appear in the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in a code chunk.
-->


In the **R** chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as `uw.png` in our main directory.  We then give it the caption of "UW logo", the label of "uwlogo", and specify that this is a figure.  Make note of the different **R** chunk options that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).

```{r uwlogo, fig.cap="UW logo"}
include_graphics(path = "figure/uw.png")
```

Here is a reference to the UW logo: Figure \@ref(fig:uwlogo).  Note the use of the `fig:` code here.  By naming the **R** chunk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here.  We can also specify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option `fig.cap`.

\clearpage

<!-- starts a new page and stops trying to place floats such as tables and figures -->

Below we will investigate how to save the output of an **R** plot and label it in a way similar to that done above.  Recall the `flights` dataset from Chapter \@ref(rmd-basics).  (Note that we've shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.)  We will next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by airline from Portland for 2014.  Note also the use of the `scale` parameter which is discussed on the next page.

```{r delaysboxplot, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean Delays by Airline", fig.width=6}
flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) +
  geom_bar(position = "identity", stat = "identity", fill = "red")
```

Here is a reference to this image: Figure \@ref(fig:delaysboxplot).

A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at <https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv>.

\clearpage

Next, we will explore the use of the `out.extra` chunk option, which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by specifying `"scale= "`. Here we use the mathematical graph stored in the "subdivision.pdf" file.

```{r subd, results="asis", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Subdiv. graph", out.extra="scale=0.75"}
include_graphics("figure/subdivision.pdf")
```

Here is a reference to this image: Figure \@ref(fig:subd).  Note that `echo=FALSE` is specified so that the **R** code is hidden in the document.

**More Figure Stuff**

Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the `out.extra` chunk option.  (Currently this only works in the PDF version of the book.)

```{r subd2, results="asis", echo=FALSE, out.extra="angle=180, scale=1.1", fig.cap="A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down"}
include_graphics("figure/subdivision.pdf")
```

As another example, here is a reference: Figure \@ref(fig:subd2).  

## Footnotes and Endnotes

You might want to footnote something. ^[footnote text] The footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes work in much the same way.

## Cross-referencing chapters and sections

The [bookdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/cross-references.html) is an excellent source for learning how to cross-reference in a bookdown project such as a huskydown document. Here we only cover the most common uses for a typical thesis. If you want something more complex or fancy, please refer to the bookdown documentation and seek help from the developers of that package.

By default, all of your chapter and section headers will get an auto-generated ID label For example, e.g., `# Chapter 1` will have an auto-generated ID `chapter-1`. Note that the ID label is all lower case, and has no spaces. If you have any kind of punctuation in your header, such as a colon (:), it will not appear in the ID label. Then in your text you can reference chapter one in your Rmd file like this: 'as discussed in Chapter `\@ref(chapter-1)`', which will print as 'as discussed in Chapter 1'

We strongly recommend that you to manually assign ID labels to your chapter header to make it easy to cross-reference. For example, at the top of the Rmd file for this chapter, you can see:

`# Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels {#ref-labels}`

The `{#ref-labels}` part of this header is the ID label. It doesn't show in the output, but is there for us to use for easy cross-referencing, because it can be short, and we don't need to change it elsewhere our document when we update the chapter header. We can use this custom ID label in our Rmd document like this: 'as discussed in Chapter `\@ref(ref-labels)`', which will print as 'as discussed in Chapter \@ref(ref-labels)'. If you need to show custom text instead of the chapter number, you use this syntax in your Rmd document: `see [my chapter about labels](#ref-labels) for more details` which will appear as 'see [my chapter about labels](#ref-labels) for more details'

To cross-reference a specific section in the same chapter, we recommend adding a custom ID label to the section header, and using that to cross-reference. For example, earlier in this chapter we have a section on tables and in the Rmd file we see `## Tables {#tables}`. We can cross-reference that in the text like this 'as discussed in the section on `[tables](#tables)`' which will appear as 'as discussed in the above section on [tables](#tables)'

To cross-reference a section in a different chapter we can use the ID label from that section directly. For example, we can write in our Rmd document `as discussed in the section on [R code chunks](#r-chunks) in Chapter \@ref(rmd-basics)` which will appear as 'as discussed in the section on [R code chunks](#r-chunks) in Chapter \@ref(rmd-basics)'.

If you prefer to cross-reference by the section number, we can use custom ID labels in our Rmd document. For example, to refer to a section in our first chapter, we can write in the Rmd document: `as discussed in section \@ref(r-chunks) in Chapter \@ref(rmd-basics)`. This will appear with section and chapter numbers like so: as 'as discussed in section \@ref(r-chunks) in Chapter \@ref(rmd-basics)'.

## Bibliographies

Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension).  In addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. Some Zotero documentation is at <http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero>.  In addition, a tutorial is available from Middlebury College at <http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/>.

_R Markdown_ uses _pandoc_ (<http://pandoc.org/>) to build its bibliographies.  One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the "at" symbol.  For example, here's a reference to a book about worrying:  [@Molina1994].  This `Molina1994` entry appears in a file called `thesis.bib` in the `bib` folder.  This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.  You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the `bib` folder.  

For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see (<http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html>)^[@reedweb2007]. There are three pages on this topic:  _bibtex_ (which talks about using BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html>), _bibtexstyles_ (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html>) and _bibman_ (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html>). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.

If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file.  You can download a variety of different style files at <https://www.zotero.org/styles>.  Make sure to download the file into the csl folder.

**Tips for Bibliographies**

- Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better.
- The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.
- When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word "and" e.g. `Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},`.
- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.
- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.

# Conclusion {-}

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.

It was written in R Markdown and $\LaTeX$, and rendered into PDF using [huskydown](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown) and [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

This document was typeset using the XeTeX typesetting system, and the [University of Washington Thesis class](http://staff.washington.edu/fox/tex/) class created by Jim Fox. Under the hood, the [University of Washington Thesis LaTeX template](https://github.com/UWIT-IAM/UWThesis) is used to ensure that documents conform precisely to submission standards. Other elements of the document formatting source code have been taken from the [Latex, Knitr, and RMarkdown templates for UC Berkeley's graduate thesis](https://github.com/stevenpollack/ucbthesis), and [Dissertate: a LaTeX dissertation template to support the production and typesetting of a PhD dissertation at Harvard, Princeton, and NYU](https://github.com/suchow/Dissertate)

The source files for this thesis, along with all the data files, have been organised into an R package, xxx, which is available at https://github.com/xxx/xxx. A hard copy of the thesis can be found in the University of Washington library.

This version of the thesis was generated on `r Sys.time()`. The repository is currently at this commit:

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# I've set eval=FALSE to ensure Travis-CI can run
