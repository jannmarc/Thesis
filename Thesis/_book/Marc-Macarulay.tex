\abstract{Public housing residents have worse health than the general population
including chronic diseases such as diabetes. Knowledge of which specific
populations within public housing residents have chronic conditions is
essential for public health agencies to implement efficient health
promotion programs. This cross-sectional design study was conducted
using data collected from Data Across Sectors for Housing and Health
partnership in King County, WA. Total population included were Medicaid
and Medicare beneficiaries compiled from Washington Health Care
Authority (n= 585,372). Associations between public housing and diabetes
status were estimated using odds ratios and corresponding 95\%
confidence intervals from crude and adjusted models. Further
associations were determined between individual public housing
authorities and diabetes status using the same crude and adjusted
models. Among study participants 10.4\% received some form public
housing assistance in 2017. In total, 9.9\% were considered to have
diabetes. The adjusted model revealed that public housing residents were
1.94 times (95\% CI: 1.88-1.99) more likely to meet the diabetes
definition compared to those not receiving housing assitance. These
findings suggest that public housing residents are more likely to be
diabetic. Further studies should explore the relationship between public
housing and diabetes over a longer period to discern the direction of
the association over time. Findings from this study can be used to
inform future interventions for diabetes treatment by both public health
and housing agencies.}

\chapter{Background and Significance}\label{rmd-basics}

\section{Public Housing}\label{public-housing}

Housing is widely acknowledged as an important social determinant of
health (Thomson, Thomas, Sellstrom, \& Petticrew, 2013). Health outcomes
driven by housing are mediated by housing quality, safety, stability,
and affordability (Taylor, 2018). There are well established links
between housing quality and morbidity ranging from mental disorders,
injuries, infectious diseases, and chronic diseases (Krieger \& Higgins,
2002). There is a growing body of evidence associating substandard and
unstable housing with poor health outcomes (Berkowitz, Kalkhoran,
Edwards, Essien, \& Baggett, 2018 ; Thomson et al., 2013). However, less
understood is the relationship between public housing and health.

The government tries to ameliorate housing problems by providing public
housing assistance, which are decent and safe subsidized rental housing
for eligible populations including low-income families, the elderly, and
persons with disabilities (HUD, 2020). Public housing Authority (PHA)
provides several types of housing subsidies that are low income public
housuing or voucher-based. A relevant study suggests that people with
voucher-based subsidies that move from areas with a high level of
poverty to areas with less poverty are associated with a lower
prevelance of obesity and diabetes(Ludwig et al., 2011). Yet, other
studies have shown that public housing residents have worse health
outcomes than other city residents (Digenis-Bury, Brooks, Chen, Ostrem,
\& Horsburgh, 2008 ; Manjarrez, Popkin, \& Guernsey, 2007). This
relationship between public housing assistance in general and chronic
conditions such as diabetes is minimally explored.

\section{Diabetes}\label{diabetes}

Diabetes is a chronic disease that is characterized by an inability of
the body to maintain a healthy blood glucose level, this can cause a
variety of symptoms that affect multiple systems in the body and can
lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The key regulator
hormone of glucose is insulin and it is produced in the pancreas. The
absence or malfunction of insulin leads to elevated blood glucose levels
called hyperglycemia. When insulin hormone is missing or ineffective the
disease is called Diabetes Mellitus and this condition has multiple
types.

\subsection{Diabetes Variants}\label{diabetes-variants}

The most common diabetes variants include type I diabetes mellitus, type
II diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes. Type I diabetes is
usually caused by genetic factors triggering an autoimmune reaction that
results in the destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas.
Also known as Juvenile Diabetes, the type I classification is typically
diagnosed relatively early in life during childhood or early adulthood.
Whereas Type II diabetes develops when the body can still produce
insulin however the amount is insufficient or when the body becomes
resistant to the effects of insulin. Type II diabetes is largely
attributed to lifestyle factors. Gestational diabetes is the least
common type and occurs during pregnancy. The prevalence of type II
diabetes is much higher than type I. In the US, type II and type I
diabetes account for approximately 91\% and 6\% of all diagnosed
diabetes cases, respectively (Bullard et al., 2018).

Diabetes is a serious chronic condition without a medical cure. The
treatment for diabetes involves disease prevention and management.
Medical treatment of diabetes primarily consists of exogenous insulin
replacement or use of medications that stimulate the pancreas to produce
endogenous insulin. Without adequate blood control, diabetes can lead to
increased risk of other conditions including vision loss, heart disease,
stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, amputation, and even premature
death.

\section{Problem Definition}\label{problem-definition}

Disease management for type II diabetics focuses on lifestyle
modification such as diet control and increased physical activity. The
goal is to promote weight loss and reduce excess fat that subsequently
both reduces insulin resistance and enhances disease control. However,
other determinants of health have been recognized to impact the
effectiveness of diabetes management, namely healthcare access, cultural
and social support, economic stability and built environments (Clark,
2014). Housing instability and food insecurity in particular have been
shown to reduce diabetes management self-efficacy for low income adults
(Vijayaraghavan, Jacobs, Seligman, \& Fernandez, 2011). Providing safe
and afforadble housing to those in need may improve overall health and
increase diabetes management efficacy.

While there is a growing number of published literature on the
correlation between substandard housing and health outcomes, few studies
specifically examine the relationship between general public housing
support and diabetes status. For this reason, the current study aimed to
explore this public health issue within a local context in King County,
WA.

In the effort to decrease the gap of knowledge between the junction of
public housing and health, Public Health Seattle and King County (PHSKC)
developed a unique partnership with King County Housing Authority (KCHA)
and Seattle Housing Authority (SHA). This partnership enabled data to be
shared across sectors with the intention of informing and measuring
future interventions that would improve the health of the county
residents. This project expands on the original research from this
collaboration revolving around health and public housing. This current
research aims to use the provided data to contribute to the literature
on the association between public housing and diabetes among Medicaid
and Medicare patients.

The findings of the study could help identify where resources for
diabetes prevention and management might be used more effectively. For
instance, PHAs can look into directly implementing diabetes prevention
programs within PHA run housing communities to reduce the burden of
diabetes. Furthermore, identifying populations with higher needs of
diabetes related care can be used as a metric for implementing health
policy.

\chapter{Methods}\label{methods}

\section{Study Setting and Study
Design}\label{study-setting-and-study-design}

The current study investigates whether public housing is associated with
risk of diabetes status among King County, WA residents who were
enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. This study uses a descriptive
cross-sectional design. The cross-sectional design is appropriate
because it allows for an estimate of a dichotomous disease outcome at a
particular point in time (Greenland \& Morgenstern, 1988).

The analysis of this study was conducted on a dataset compiled from the
King County \emph{Data Across Sectors for Housing and Health (DASHH)}
partnership. The findings from the original initial study have
previously been reported (Public Health - Seattle \& King County, 2018).

\section{Data Sources}\label{data-sources}

In an effort to reduce fragmented data siloes across different sectors,
the DASHH partnership was formed in 2016 between Public Health - Seattle
and King County, and two public housing authories, King County Housing
Authority and Seattle Housing Authority. The primary objectives for
DASHH were to join health and housing administrative data together to
inform and measure future interventions, relating to policy, outreach,
and program evaluation that would improve the health of King County
residents, as well as to disseminate actionable data to key health and
housing stakeholders.

KCHA provides housing assistance to families and individuals that earn
less than the county median income to approximately 55,000 people in the
King County area excluding the cities of Seattle and Renton. While SHA
predominatly focuses on people within Seattle, with nearly 35,000 people
scattered throughout 400 sites across the city.

The housing data originated from both KCHA and SHA extracted from a
standradized US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) form.
This data source contained elements that included demographic
information and period of enrollment for families and individuals.
Claims and enrollment data for Medicaid and Medicare were provided by
the Washington Health Care Authority (HCA) and the WA Office of
Financial Management, respectively. Enrollment data contained
information on who was receiving health insurance benefits. Claims data
provided elements such as diagnosis codes and these were used to
identify acute events and chronic conditions. The separated health and
housing data sources were linked together probabilistically to create a
unique identifier. Further detail on the process of joining data can be
found in the King County Data Across Sectors for Housing and Health,
2018 Report (Public Health - Seattle \& King County, 2018). This report
provides a detailed technical process of linking Medicaid data, but this
approach was similar to both Mediaid and Medicare data used for this
study.

\section{Study Population}\label{study-population}

The study population was participants that were enrolled in either
Medicare or Medicaid programs. Further eligibility for study
participation included King County, Washington residency and at least 11
months of Medicare or Medicaid coverage in 2017. The 11 month minimum
coverage restriction provides a more complete picture of healthcare
usage in 2017, reducing the artifical inflation of the eligble
population with people that had little chance of meeting the diabetes
definiton. The overall number of participants derived from the DASHH
dataset totaled 585,372.

\subsection{Exposure Variable}\label{exposure-variable}

The exposure variable for this study was public housing assistance
status. This was extracted from the HUD-50058 form which was provided by
the PHAs. The HUD-50058 form provides information on families that
participate in public housing or Section 8 rental subsidy programs (HUD,
2020). Housing assistance is separated into 3 main types:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Housing Choice Vouchers - vouchers provided to recipients to rent
  units on the private housing market
\item
  Public housing properties and units - subsidized housing managed by
  PHAs
\item
  Project-based vouchers - subsidized housing units not managed by PHAs
\end{itemize}
Responses on the HUD-50058 form were combined into a composite public
housing binary variable. Study participants that were not enrolled in
any of the listed housing assistance programs were not placed in the PHA
category. Whereas d any of the 3 types of housing assistance were
categorized into the PHA group.

\subsection{Outcome Variable}\label{outcome-variable}

The outcome variable for this study was diabetes status. This was
defined using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) algorithm (Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, 2020). According to the CCW, a participant meets the
criteria if they have at least 1 inpatient, skilled nursing facility,
home health agency visit or 2 hospital outpatient or carrier claims with
diabetes diagnoses codes as outlined by the chronic conditions reference
list within the last 2 years(Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
2020). This definition does not specify diabetes variant but instead
accounts for any type diabetes diagnoses. The diabetes status outcome
variable was dichotomous.

\subsection{Potential Confounders}\label{potential-confounders}

Potential confounders were identified based on literature review. This
study considers age, race and ethnicity and gender as potential
confounding variables. Each of these variables were selected due to the
increased baseline risk for participants to be either in public housing
or have diabetes. It is known that diabetes is an age-related disease,
with a higher risk for older populations (Selvin \& Parrinello, 2013).
Age was presented as a discrete variable for the participants age in
2017. Similarly, according to CDC data, racial minority groups may be
differentially at risk for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared to
their white counterparts (CDC, 2020; Divers et al., 2020 ). Although the
discrete variable for age was used in the statistical analyses, age is
presented ategorically in the descriptive analyses for a simpler
distribution description. Mean and median age were also shown for each
category. Race and ethnicity variable was defined categorically and
included: American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian, Asian Pacific
Islander, Black/African American, Latino, Multiple, Native Hawaiian and
Pacific Islander, Other, Unknown, and White. Due to the limitations of
the how Medicare data categorizes race, this study categorized Asian
Pacific Islander as a distinct group from the other seperate groups of
Asian and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander. Gender was selected
because both psychosocial and biological factors are responsible for sex
and gender diabetes risk differences (Kautzky-Willer, Harreiter, \&
Pacini, 2016). Gender was grouped categorically and included: Female,
Male, and Multiple.

\section{Analyses}\label{analyses}

For the statistical analyses, logistic regression models were fitted to
assess the risk of diabetes status in relation to public housing
assistance status. This analysis is well-suited for this study because
logistic regression analyses allows for measuring the association of an
effect towards a binomial response variable by combining multiple
variables to avoid confounding (Sperandei, 2014).

There were two main research questions in this study. The primary
research question dwelved into the relationship between public housing
assistance and diabetes. The secondary question looked into the
relationship between each of the public housing authorities and diabetes
status. The distinction between these analyses are that first provides
the likelihood of meeting the diabetes definiton if a person was
receiving public housing assistance and the second provides a more
specific estimate for each of the housing authority.

Crude and adjusted models were fitted to answer the research questions.
The adjusted model accounted for age race and ethinicity and gender
variables.The models were used to determine the odds ratios (OR) and
corresponding 95\% confidence intervals. Findings were statistically
significant if the estimates did not cross the confidence intervals and
p-values were below \textless{}0.05 threshold. Analyses were conducted
using statistical software R and RStudio version 3.6.0.

\chapter{Results}\label{ref-labels}

\section{Descriptive Statistics}\label{descriptive-statistics}

Among King County residents on Medicaid or Medicare in 2017, 10.4\% also
received support from a PHA (5.9\% were in KCHA and 4.6\% in SHA) (See
Table \ref{tab:table1}). A greater proportion of people in the PHA
population met the definition of diabetes at 12.7\% compared to the
non-PHA group with 9.6\%. Overall, 9.9\% met the definition of diabetes.
Additionally, the population age distributions were different between
PHA status; the non-PHA category had an older population (median of age
of 62.0, mean age of 50.0 compared with the PHA population median and
mean age of 34.0 and 35.7, respectively). The PHA group were more
racially and ethnically diverse however, the gender distribution between
the two groups were similar.

\section{Public Housing and Diabetes}\label{public-housing-and-diabetes}

In the primary analysis, the association between diabetes status and
public housing assistance, the crude model showed that the odds ratio of
having diabetes was 1.34 fold greater for those receiving public housing
assistance (See Table \ref{tab:table2}). This effect increased in the
adjusted model when the potential confounders were added, PHA residents
were 94\% more likely to meet the definition of diabetes compared to
those that were non-PHA residents (See Table \ref{tab:table3}).

\section{Public Housing Authorities and
Diabetes}\label{public-housing-authorities-and-diabetes}

In the secondary analysis, estimating the association between diabetes
status and the specific public housing authorities, the crude model
showed that the odds of meeting the definition of diabetes were 1.28
times greater among KCHA residents and 1.42 times greater among SHA
residents (See Table \ref{tab:table4}). The adjusted model revealed that
among KCHA residents, the odds of meeting the definition of diabetes
were 2.16 times higher and 1.70 for SHA residents compared to non-PHA
residents (See Table \ref{tab:table5}).

\chapter{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}

Findings from this study indicate that, after adjusting for age, gender
and race and ethnicity, public housing assistance was positively
associated with diabetes status. The findings also suggest that the
increased burden of diabetes is not evenly spread between the two PHAs
included in the study.

The increased burden of diabetes among those supported by PHAs observed
in this study reinforces results to a similiar study that compared
public housing residents in Boston, MA to other city residents
(Digenis-Bury et al., 2008). A likely reason for these findings is that
PHAs spefically target individuals with high-needs when allocating
housing resources, this results in an overall sicker PHA population from
the beggining. A factor that may contribute to these fidings is that
public housing residents were more likely to be racial and ethnic
minorities and the prevalence of diabetes is often greater for racial
and ethnic populations (Chow, Foster, Gonzalez, \& McIver, 2012).
Another possible explanation is that areas and neighborhoods with a high
level of poverty, such as where public housing properties may be located
tend to also have a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes (Ludwig et
al., 2011).

These findings suggest that public housing assistance recipients have a
greater need for diabetes treatment and programs run by PHAs could be an
avenue in which resources on diabetes prevention and management may be
more effective. A health promotion intervention that utilized homecare
nurses to implement a diabetes prevention program in public housing
communities proved to be successful and can be a viable option in
improving health outcomes (Whittemore, Rosenberg, Gilmore, Withey, \&
Breault, 2014). Considering the population demographics in the PHA
group, another successful strategy may be to implement a culturally
competent diabetes care intervention program (Zeh, Sandhu, Cannaby, \&
Sturt, 2012).

However, the preliminary findings in this study that suggests that PHA
recipients are more likely to be diabetic are inferential and therefore
cannot be interpreted as a causal relationship. As previously mentioned,
substandard and unstable housing has been linked with worse diabetes
health outcomes, however stable housing provided by PHA has been
associated with the ability for participants to afford diabetes-related
financial expenses (Keene, Henry, Gormley, \& Ndumele, 2018).
Additionally, when housing needs are met participants are able to
prioritize diabetes self-management, avoiding potential complications
(Keene et al., 2018). Those participants with diabetes prior to
receiving public housing assistance could potentially see a reduction in
diabetes related complications over time. Furthermore, housing mobility,
a strategy that helps low income people move to neighboorhoods with
better resources through housing vouchers has proven to be a succesful
policy in terms of improved health outcomes (Gale, 2018).

Strengths of this study include the population-based study design that
allows for estimation of disease impact on a broad scale and the
well-defined study population. The data used in this study were also
from reliable sources with careful and normally complete documentation,
subsequently reducing the impact of information bias.

\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}

There are several limitations to note. First, there may have been
unmeasured potential confounders that have not been included in the
analyses. Other elements that are recognized to be potential confounders
for diabetes may have been useful to include in this study like
socioeconomic status and other health characteristics like BMI. Given
the obtained data, these elements were not available and thus not
accounted for in this study.

Another limitation is that due to the inherent characteristic of claims
data, the population captured in the study were only those that sought
healthcare services for diabetes care or diabetes related outcomes.
People who may have been diabetic during this period but were
asymptomatic or those who had been previously diagnosed with diabetes
but did not seek care within the time frame provided by the CCW
algorithm definition of diabetes were not captured in the study.
Consequently, the eligible population in this study cannot provide a
prevalence estimate by themselves.

Despite the limitations, this study contributes to our understanding of
government subsidized housing and diabetes self-management the findings
are generalizable to low-income, racially, and ethnically diverse
populations with diabetes who obtain health care in safety-net health
settings. More specifically, these findings provide estimates for those
with diabetes in public housing and can be used to inform and evaluate
existing interventions as well as create new strategies for health
promotion within this population. Future studies should continue
investigating the relationship between public housing and diabetes and
in particular further studies should explore the association over a
longer time period.
