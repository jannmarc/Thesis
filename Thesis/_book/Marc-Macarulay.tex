\chapter{Background and Significance}\label{rmd-basics}

\section{Public Housing}\label{public-housing}

Housing is widely awknowledged as an important social determinant of
health({\textbf{???}}). Health outcomes driven by housing are mediated
by housing quality, safety, stability and affordability({\textbf{???}}).
There are well established links between housing quality and morbidity
from mental disorders, injuries infectious diseases, and chronic
diseases({\textbf{???}}). There is a growing body of evidence
associating substandard housing with poor health outcomes, however, the
relationship between public housing and health is minimaly explored.
Public housing provides decent and safe subsidized rental housing for
eligible populations including low-income families, the elderly, and
persons with disabilities (HUD, n.d.). Relevant studies have shown that
public housing residents have worse health outcomes than other city
residents ({\textbf{???}} and ({\textbf{???}})). Even less understood is
the relationship between public housing and chronic health conditions
like diabetes.

\section{Diabetes}\label{diabetes}

Diabetes is a chronic disease that is characterized by an inability of
the body to maintain a healthy blood glucose level, this can cause a
variety of symptoms that affect multiple systems in the body and can
lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The key regulator
hormone of glucose is insulin and it is produced in the pancreas. The
absence or malfunction of insulin leads to elevated blood glucose levels
called hyperglycemia. When insulin hormone is missing or ineffective the
disease is called Diabetes Mellitus and this condition has multiple
types.

\subsection{Diabetes Variants}\label{diabetes-variants}

The most common diabetes variants include type I diabetes mellitus, type
II diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes. Type I diabetes is
usually caused by genetic factors triggering an autoimmune reaction that
results in the destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas.
Also known as Juvenile Diabetes, the type I classification is typically
diagnosed relatively early in life during childhood or early adulthood.
Whereas, Type II diabetes develops when the body can still produce
insulin however the amount is insuffient or when the body becomes
resistant to the effects of insulin. Type II diabetes is largely
attributed to lifestyle factors. Gestational diabetes is the least
common type and occurs during pregnancy. The prevalance of type II
diabetes are much higher than type I. In the US, type II and type I
diabetes account for approximately 91\% and 6\% of all diagnosesd
diabetes cases ({\textbf{???}}).

Diabetes is a serious chronic condition without a medical cure. The
treatment for diabetes involves disease prevention and management.
Medical treatment of diabetes primarily consists of exogenous insulin
replacement or use of medications that stimulate the pancreas to produce
endogenous insulin. Without adequate blood control, diabetes can lead to
increased risk of other conditions including vision loss, heart disease,
stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, amputation and even premature
death.

\section{Problem Definition}\label{problem-definition}

Disease management for type II diabetics focuses on lifestyle
modification such as diet control and increased physical activity. The
goal is to promote weight loss and reduce excess fat that subsequently
reduces insulin resistance and enhances disease control. However, other
determinants of health have been recognized to impact the effectiveness
of diabetes management, namely healthcare access, cultural and social
support, economic stability and built environments ({\textbf{???}}).
Housing instability and food insecurity in particular have been shown to
reduce diabetes management self-efficacy in low income adults
({\textbf{???}}).

Again, while there are numerous published literature on the association
between substandard housing and chronic conditions like diabetes, few
studies examine the relationship between public housing and diabetes.
For this reason, the current study aimed to explore this public health
issue within a local context in King County, WA.

In the effort to decrease the gap of knowledge between the junction of
public housing and health, Public Health Seattle and King County (PHSKC)
formed a unique partnership with King County Housing Authority (KCHA),
Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) enabling data to be shared across
sectors with the intention of informing and measuring future
interventions that would improve the health of the county residents.
This research aims to use the provided data to contribute to the
literature on the association between public housing and diabetes among
medicaid and medicare patients.

\chapter{Methods}\label{methods}

\section{Study Setting and Study
Design}\label{study-setting-and-study-design}

The current study investigates whether public housing is asociated with
risk of diabetes status among King County, WA residents who were
enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. This study uses a descriptive
cross-sectional design. The cross-sectional design is appropriate
because it allows for an estimate of a dichotomous disease outcome at a
particular point in time ({\textbf{???}}).

The analysis of this study was conducted on a dataset compiled from the
King County \emph{Data Across Sectors for Housing and Health (DASHH)}
partnership. The findings from the original initial study have
previously been reported (Public Health - Seattle \& King County, 2018).

\section{Data Sources}\label{data-sources}

In an effort to reduce fragmented data siloes across different sectors,
the DASHH partnership was formed in 2016 between Public Health - Seattle
and King County , and two public housing authories, King County Housing
Authority and Seattle Housing Authority. The primary objectives for
DASHH were to join health and housing administrative data together to
inform and measure future interventions, relating to policy, outreach,
and program evaluation that would improve the health of King County
residents, as well as to disseminate actionable data with key health and
housing stakeholders.

The housing data provided by both KCHA and SHA originated from the US
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This data source
contained elements that included demographic information and period of
enrollment for families and individuals. Claims and enrollment for
Medicaid and Medicare data were from Washington Health Care Authority
(HCA) which was provided to PHSKC. Enrollment data contained information
on who was recieving Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Claims data
provided elements such as diagnosis codes that were used to identify
acute events and chronic conditions. All these data sources were linked
together by a unique identifier ID.

\section{Study Population}\label{study-population}

The study population were participants that were enrolled in either
Medicare or Medicaid programs. Further eligibility for study
participation included King County, Washington residency and at least 11
months of Medicare or Medicaid coverage in 2017. The overall number of
participants derived from the DASHH dataset totaled 585,372.

\subsection{Exposure Variable}\label{exposure-variable}

The exposure variable for this study was public housing assistance
status. This was extracted from the HUD-50058 form which was provided by
the PHAs. The HUD-50058 form provides information on families that
participate in public housing or Section 8 rental subsidy programs
{[}Source{]}. Housing assitance is separated into 3 main types:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Housing Choice Vouchers - vouchers provided to recipients to rent
  units on the private housing market
\item
  Public housing properties and units - subisidized housing managed by
  PHAs
\item
  Project-based vouchers - subsidized housing units not managed by PHAs
\end{itemize}
Responses on the HUD-50058 form were combined into a composite public
housing binary variable. Study partipants that were not enrolled in any
of the listed housing assistance programs were coded as 0 for PHA
status. Whereas, those responses that contained any of the 3 types of
housing housing assistance was given a 1 for PHA status.

\subsection{Outcome Variable}\label{outcome-variable}

The outcome variable for this study was diabetes status.This was defined
using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chonic
Conditions Warehouse (CCW) algorithm {[}Source{]}. According to the CCW,
a participant meets the criteria if they have at least 1 inpatient,
skilled nursing facility, home health agency visit or 2 hospital
outpatient or carrier claims with diabetes diagnoses codes as outlined
by the chronic conditions reference list within the last 2
years{[}Source{]}. This definition does not specify diabetes variant but
instead accounts for any type diabetes diagnoses. The diabetes status
outcome variable was dichotomous, given a 0 or 1. Those that did not
meet the CCW alogrithm were coded a 0 and those that met the criteria
were coded as 1 for diabetes status.

\subsection{Potenetial Confounders}\label{potenetial-confounders}

Potential confounders were identified based on literature review. This
study considers age, race and ethnicity and gender as potential
confounding variables. Each of these variables were selected due to the
increased baseline risk for partipants to be either in public housing or
have diabetes. It is known that diabetes is an age-related disease, with
a higher risk for older populations (Selvin \& Parrinello, 2013). Age
was presented as a discrete variable for the partipants age in 2017.
Similarly, according to CDC data, racial minority groups may be
differentially at risk for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared to
their white counterparts (Divers et al., 2020 \& CDC (2020)). Race and
ethnicity variable was defined categorically and included: American
Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian, Asian Pacific Islander, Black/African
American, Latino, Multiple, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Other,
Unknown, and White. Gender was selected because both psychosocial and
biological factors are responsible for sex and gender diabetes risk
differences (Kautzky-Willer, Harreiter, \& Pacini, 2016). Gender was
grouped categorically and included: Female, Male, and Multiple.

\section{Analyses}\label{analyses}

As is common in epidemiological and health services research,
demographic characteristics were presented to describe the population
distribition ({\textbf{???}}). Descriptive analyses were first used to
list the percentages for each of the demographic categorical variables.
(See table 1). The demographics table is arranged by PHA status, this
included: KCHA, SHA, combined PHA and non-PHA. Although the discrete
variable for age was used in the statistical analyses, age was reported
categorically in the descriptive analyses for a simpler layout. Mean and
median age were also shown for each category.

For the statistical analyses, logistic regression models were fitted to
assess the risk of diabetes status in relation to public housing
assistance status. This analysis is appropriate for this study because
logistic reregression analyses allows for measuring the association of
an effect towards a binomial response variable by combining multiple
variables to avoid confounding ({\textbf{???}}).

Two models were used to determine the odds ratios (OR) and coresponding
95\% confidence intervals for the association between public housing
assistance and diabetes status. The models used were the unadjusted
model, without any other variables included in the analysis and the
adjusted model including age, race and ethnicity and gender variables.
In addition, models were fit to determine the odds ratio of diabetes
status for each of the public housing authority. Similarly, the
unadjusted model and the adjusted model that included age, race and
ethinicity and gender variables were used to determine the association
for the second analysis. Findings were statistical significant if the
estimates did not cross the the confidence intervals and p-values were
below \textless{}0.05 cutoff. Analyses were conducted using R version
3.6.0.

\chapter{Results}\label{ref-labels}

\section{Descriptive Statistics}\label{descriptive-statistics}

Among the study participants, the proportion of people that were in the
PHA category was 10.4\% and of that, 5.9\% were with KCHA and 4.6\% with
SHA (\textbf{See Table 1}). The majority of the study participants,
89.5\% did not have any public housing assitance in 2017. Descriptive
analysis revealed that PHA population had a greater proportion of people
meeting the definition of diabetes at 12.7\% compared to the non-PHA
group with 9.6\%. Overall, 9.9\% were considered to meet the definiton
of diabetes and the rest, 90.1\% were not considered to have diabetes.

Additionally, the population age distribution were different bewtween
PHA status, the non-PHA category had an older population with a median
of age of 62 and a mean age of 50 compared to the PHA population with a
median and mean age of 34 and 35.7 respectively. The PHA group were more
racial and ethnically diverse than the non-PHA group. However, the
gender distribution between the two groups were similar.

\section{Public Housing and Diabetes}\label{public-housing-and-diabetes}

For the primary analysis, the assocation between diabetes status and
public housing assistance, the crude model showed that the odds ratio of
having diabetes was 1.34 fold greater for those with public housing
assistance (table 2). In the adjusted model, PHA residents were 94\%
more likely to meet the definition of diabetes compared to those that
were non-PHA residents. (Table 3)

\section{Public Housing Authorities and
Diabetes}\label{public-housing-authorities-and-diabetes}

In the second analysis, the association between diabetes status and the
specific public housing authorities, the crude model showed that the
odds of meeting the definiton of diabetes were 1.28 times greater among
KCHA residents and 1.42 times greater among SHA residents. The adjusted
model revealed that among KCHA residents the odds of meeting the
definition of diabetes were 2.16 times higher and 1.70 for SHA residents
compared to non-PHA residents. (table 4)

\chapter{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}

Findings from this study indicate that public housing assistance was
associated with diabetes status. Even after adjusting for potential
confounders (age, gender, race and ethinicity) the effect of public
housing on diabetes status were increased. Furthermore, findings also
suggest that when divided into PHA agency in the crude model, KCHA
residents where were less likely to meet the definition of diabetes than
SHA residents but still more likely than the non-PHA group. After adjust
for potential confounders, the effect of association between PHA agency
on diabetes saw a greater increase for KCHA residents than SHA
residents.

The increased risk of diabetes observed in our study in relation to
public housing had similar results to another study that compared public
housing residents in Boston, MA to other city residents for health
outcomes including diabetes that revealed worse health outcomes for
public housing residents ({\textbf{???}}). A potential explanation of
these findings may be attributed to the fact that public housing
resisdents were more likely to be racial and ethnic minorities and the
prevalance of diabetes is often greater for racial and ethinic
populations{[}@{]}.

These findings suggest that public housing may be an avenue in which
diabetes management may be of higher priority.

\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}

There are serveral limitations to note. First, there was the huge
reduction in the eligible population. People who met the definition of
diabetes in this population for this study was significantly reduced
from approximately 43,000 to 13,600 after applying the inclusion
criteria, a 69\% decrease. Other potentially significant data could be
gleamed from those missing in the diabetes group among this population.

Another limitation is that this study does not provide the prevalence of
diabetes due to the inherent characteristic of claims data. The
population captured in the study were only those that sought health care
services for diabetes related outcomes. People who may have had diabetes
but were asymptomatic or those who had been previously diagnosed with
diabetes but did not seek care within the time frame of meeting the
definition of diabetes were not captured in the study.

Despite the limitations, this study contributes to our understanding of
poverty and diabetes self-management the findings are generalizable to
low-income, racially and ethnically diverse populations with diabetes
who obtain health care in safety-net health settings
