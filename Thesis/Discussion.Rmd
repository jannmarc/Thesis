In this study population, we found that duration of breastfeeding, but not history (yes/no) of breastfeeding, was inversely associated with new onset of RA. However, associations were attenuated after adjustment for potential confounders (age, race, education, income, smoking, oral contraceptive use, parity, and time between last full-term pregnancy and onset of RA). Associations were not modified by race.

The reduced risk of RA observed in our study, in relation to duration of breast feeding, is similar to some (Karlson, 2004; Pikwer, 2009; Adab, 2014; Brun, 1995; Orellana, 2017), but not other studies (Brennan, 1994; Berglin, 2010), that also observed that breastfeeding was associated with a lower risk of RA. Karlson et al. reported an inverse association between duration of breastfeeding and risk of RA among female nurses in the Nursesâ€™ Health Study; they reported that the adjusted risk of RA for women who breastfed for 24 months or longer was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3-0.8) compared to females that did not breastfeed (Karlson, 2004). Similarly, in a Swedish study, Pikwer et al. concluded that the risk of developing RA may be reduced by a long history of breastfeeding; they reported that the ORs for the risk of RA associated with breastfeeding for 13 months or longer and for 1 to 12 months, compared to no history of breastfeeding, were 0.46 (95% CI: 0.24-0.91) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.45-1.20), respectively (Pikwer, 2009). Among Chinese women, Adab et al. reported that longer duration of breastfeeding may be associated with a decreased risk of RA; for those who breastfed for 36 months or longer, compared with women who never breastfed, the adjusted OR was 0.54 (95% CI 0.29-1.01) (Adab, 2014). Brun et al., in a population-based study, reported an association between decreased mortality from RA and the total time of lactation; they reported a mortality rate ratio of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.28-0.85) for those with total lactation of 30 months or greater compared to those who had zero months of lactation 9(Brun, 1995). Orellana et al. reported a potential inverse association between breastfeeding length and ACPA-Positive RA; women who breastfed for 7-12 months had an OR of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.72-1.15) and women who breastfed for 13 months or longer 0.74 (95%CI: 0.59-0.93) compared to those who breastfed for 6 months or less and adjusted for age and residential area, p-value trend = 0.0086 (Orellana, 2017). However, they reported that the association was not statistically significant when adjusted for age, residential area, smoking, and alcohol consumption (Orellana, 2017).

## Limitations

Despite the significance of these findings, there are serveral limitations to note. First, there was the huge reduction in the eligible population. People who met the definition of diabetes in this population for this study was significantly reduced from approximately 43,000 to 13,600 after applying the inclusion criteria, a 69% decrease. Other potentially significant data could be gleamed from those missing in the diabetes group among this population.

Another limitation is that this study does not provide the prevalence of diabetes due to the inherent characteristic of claims data. The population captured in the study were only those that sought health care services for diabetes related outcomes. People who may have had diabetes but were asymptomatic or those who had been previously diagnosed with diabetes but did not seek care within the time frame of meeting the definition of diabetes were not captured in the study.
