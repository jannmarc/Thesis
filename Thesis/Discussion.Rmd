##Discussion
Findings from this study indicate that, after adjusting for age, gender and race and ethnicity, public housing assistance was positively associated with diabetes status. The findings also suggest that the increased burden of diabetes is not evenly spread between the two PHAs included in the study.

The increased burden of diabetes among those supported by PHAs observed in this study reinforces results to a similiar study that compared public housing residents in Boston, MA to other city residents [@Digenis-Bury2008]. A likely reason for these findings is that PHAs spefically target individuals with high-needs when allocating housing resources, this results in an overall sicker PHA population from the beggining. A factor that may contribute to these fidings is that public housing residents were more likely to be racial and ethnic minorities and the prevalence of diabetes is often greater for racial and ethnic populations [@Chow2012]. Another possible explanation is that areas and neighborhoods with a high level of poverty, such as where public housing properties may be located tend to also have a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes [@Ludwig2011].

These findings suggest that public housing assistance recipients have a greater need for diabetes treatment and programs run by PHAs could be an avenue in which resources on diabetes prevention and management may be more effective. A health promotion intervention that utilized homecare nurses to implement a diabetes prevention program in public housing communities proved to be successful and can be a viable option in improving health outcomes [@Whittemore2014]. Considering the population demographics in the PHA group, another successful strategy may be to implement a culturally competent diabetes care intervention program [@Zeh2012].

However, the preliminary findings in this study that suggests that PHA recipients are more likely to be diabetic are inferential and therefore cannot be interpreted as a causal relationship. As previously mentioned, substandard and unstable housing has been linked with worse diabetes health outcomes, however stable housing provided by PHA has been associated with the ability for participants to afford diabetes-related financial expenses [@Keene2018]. Additionally, when housing needs are met participants are able to prioritize diabetes self-management, avoiding potential complications [@Keene2018]. Those participants with diabetes prior to receiving public housing assistance could potentially see a reduction in diabetes related complications over time. Furthermore, housing mobility, a strategy that helps low income people move to neighboorhoods with better resources through housing vouchers has proven to be a succesful policy in terms of improved health outcomes [@Gale2018].

Strengths of this study include the population-based study design that allows for estimation of disease impact on a broad scale and the well-defined study population. The data used in this study were also from reliable sources with careful and normally complete documentation, subsequently reducing the impact of information bias.

## Limitations
There are several limitations to note. First, there may have been unmeasured potential confounders that have not been included in the analyses. Other elements that are recognized to be potential confounders for diabetes may have been useful to include in this study like socioeconomic status and other health characteristics like BMI. Given the obtained data, these elements were not available and thus not accounted for in this study.      

Another limitation is that due to the inherent characteristic of claims data, the population captured in the study were only those that sought healthcare services for diabetes care or diabetes related outcomes. People who may have been diabetic during this period but were asymptomatic or those who had been previously diagnosed with diabetes but did not seek care within the time frame provided by the CCW algorithm definition of diabetes were not captured in the study. Consequently, the eligible population in this study cannot provide a prevalence estimate by themselves.

Despite the limitations, this study contributes to our understanding of government subsidized housing and diabetes self-management the findings are generalizable to low-income, racially, and ethnically diverse populations with diabetes who obtain health care in safety-net health settings. More specifically, these findings provide estimates for those with diabetes in public housing and can be used to inform and evaluate existing interventions as well as create new strategies for health promotion within this population. Future studies should continue investigating the relationship between public housing and diabetes and in particular further studies should explore the association over a longer time period.
