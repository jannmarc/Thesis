##Discussion

Findings from this study indicate that public housing assistance was associated with diabetes status. Even after adjusting for potential confounders (age, gender, race and ethinicity) the effect of public housing on diabetes status were increased.



## Limitations

There are serveral limitations to note. First, there was the huge reduction in the eligible population. People who met the definition of diabetes in this population for this study was significantly reduced from approximately 43,000 to 13,600 after applying the inclusion criteria, a 69% decrease. Other potentially significant data could be gleamed from those missing in the diabetes group among this population.

Another limitation is that this study does not provide the prevalence of diabetes due to the inherent characteristic of claims data. The population captured in the study were only those that sought health care services for diabetes related outcomes. People who may have had diabetes but were asymptomatic or those who had been previously diagnosed with diabetes but did not seek care within the time frame of meeting the definition of diabetes were not captured in the study.

Despite the limitations, this study contributes to our understanding of poverty and diabetes self-management the findings are generalizable to low-income, racially and ethnically diverse populations with diabetes who obtain health care in safety-net health settings
