##Discussion
Findings from this study indicate that public housing assistance was associated with diabetes status. Even after adjusting for potential confounders (age, gender, race and ethinicity) the effect of public housing on diabetes status was increased. Furthermore, findings also suggest that when divided into PHA agency in the crude model, KCHA residents where were less likely to meet the definition of diabetes than SHA residents but still more likely than the non-PHA group. After adjust for potential confounders, the effect of association between PHA agency on diabetes saw a greater increase for KCHA residents than SHA residents.  

The increased risk of diabetes observed in our study in relation to public housing had similar results to another study that compared public housing residents in Boston, MA to other city residents for health outcomes including diabetes that revealed worse health outcomes for public housing residents [@Digenis-Bury2008]. A potential explanation of these findings may be attributed to the fact that public housing resisdents were more likely to be racial and ethnic minorities and the prevalance of diabetes is often greater for racial and ethinic populations[@Chow2012].Another possible explanation is that areas and neighborhoods with a high level of poverty, such that public housing properties may be located tend to also have a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes [@Ludwig2012]. 

These findings suggest that public housing may be an avenue in which diabetes management may be of higher priority.  

## Limitations
There are serveral limitations to note. First, there was the huge reduction in the eligible population. People who met the definition of diabetes in this population for this study was significantly reduced from approximately 43,000 to 13,600 after applying the inclusion criteria, a 69% decrease. Other potentially significant data could be gleamed from those missing in the diabetes group among this population.

Another limitation is that this study does not provide the prevalence of diabetes due to the inherent characteristic of claims data. The population captured in the study were only those that sought health care services for diabetes related outcomes. People who may have had diabetes but were asymptomatic or those who had been previously diagnosed with diabetes but did not seek care within the time frame of meeting the definition of diabetes were not captured in the study.

Despite the limitations, this study contributes to our understanding of poverty and diabetes self-management the findings are generalizable to low-income, racially and ethnically diverse populations with diabetes who obtain health care in safety-net health settings
