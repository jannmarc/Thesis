##Discussion
Findings from this study indicate that public housing assistance was associated with diabetes status. After adjusting for potential confounders (age, gender, race and ethinicity) the effect of public housing on diabetes status increased even greater. Furthermore, findings also suggest that when stratified into PHA agency in the crude model, KCHA residents where were less likely to meet the definition of diabetes than SHA residents but still more likely than the non-PHA group. After adjust for potential confounders, the effect of association between PHA agency on diabetes saw a greater increase for KCHA residents than SHA residents.  

The increased risk of diabetes observed in this study in relation to public housing had similar results to another study that compared public housing residents in Boston, MA to other city residents for health outcomes including diabetes that revealed worse health outcomes for public housing residents [@Digenis-Bury2008]. A potential explanation of these findings may be attributed to the fact that public housing resisdents were more likely to be racial and ethnic minorities and the prevalance of diabetes is often greater for racial and ethinic populations [@Chow2012]. Another possible explanation is that areas and neighborhoods with a high level of poverty, such as where public housing properties may be located tend to also have a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes [@Ludwig2011].

These findings suggest that public housing residents have a greater need for diabetes treatment and could be an avenue in which resources on diabetes prevention and management may be more effective. A health promotion intervention that utilized homecare nurses to implement a diabetes prevention program in public housing communities proved to be sucessful and can be a viable option in improving health outcomes [@Whittemore2014]. Considering the population demographics in the PHA group, another successful strategy may be to implement a culturally competent diabetes care intervention program [@Zeh2012].

In contrast, the preliminary findings in this study suggesting PHA recipients are more likely to be diabetic cannot be interpreted as a casual relationship. As previously mentioned, substandard and unstable housing has been linked with worse diabetes health outcomes, however stable housing provided by PHA has been associated with the ability for participants to afford diabetes-related financial expenses [@Kenne2018]. Additionally, when housing needs are met participants are able to prioritize diabetes self-management, avoiding potential complications [@Keene2018]. Those participants with diabetes prior to receiving public housing assistance could potentially see a reduction in diabetes related complications over time.

Strengths of the current study include the population-based study design and the well characterized study population. The data were carefully documented with complete reproductive
10history from in person interviews, including specific timing and duration of breastfeeding. Potential limitations of this study include misclassification, unmeasured and residual confounding, generalizability, and limited study power.

## Limitations
There are serveral limitations to note. First, there was the huge reduction in the eligible population. People who met the definition of diabetes in this population for this study was significantly reduced from approximately 43,000 to 13,600 after applying the inclusion criteria, a 69% decrease. Other potentially significant data could be gleamed from those missing in the diabetes group among this population.

Another limitation is that this study does not provide the prevalence of diabetes due to the inherent characteristic of claims data. The population captured in the study were only those that sought health care services for diabetes related outcomes. People who may have had diabetes but were asymptomatic or those who had been previously diagnosed with diabetes but did not seek care within the time frame of meeting the definition of diabetes were not captured in the study.

Despite the limitations, this study contributes to our understanding of poverty and diabetes self-management the findings are generalizable to low-income, racially and ethnically diverse populations with diabetes who obtain health care in safety-net health settings
