abstract = {The steep rise of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated complicationsgoalong with mounting evidence of clinically important sex and gender differences. T2DM is more frequently diagnosed at lower age and body mass index in men; however, the most prominent risk factor, which is obesity, is more common in women. Generally, large sex-ratio differences across countries are observed. Diversities in biology, culture, lifestyle, environment, and socioeconomic status impact differences between males and females in predisposition, development, and clinical presentation. Genetic effects and epigenetic mechanisms, nutritional factors and sedentary lifestyle affect risk and complications differently in both sexes. Furthermore, sex hormones have a great impact on energy metabolism, body composition, vascular function, and inflammatory responses. Thus, endocrine imbalances relate to unfavorable cardiometabolic traits, observable in women with androgen excess or men with hypogonadism. Both biological and psychosocial factors are responsible for sex and gender differences in diabetes risk and outcome. Overall, psychosocial stress appears to have greater impact onwomenrather than on men. In addition, womenhave greater increases of cardiovascular risk, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality than men, compared with nondiabetic subjects. However, when dialysis therapy is initiated, mortality is comparable in both males and females. Diabetes appears to attenuate the protective effect of the female sex in the development of cardiac diseases and nephropathy. Endocrine and behavioral factors are involved in gender inequalities and affect the outcome. More research regarding sex-dimorphic pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and its complications could contribute to more personalized diabetes care in the future and would thus promote more awareness in terms of sex- and gender-specific risk factors.},

abstract = {Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases among persons aged {\textless}20 years (1). Onset of diabetes in childhood and adolescence is associated with numerous complications, including diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy, and has a substantial impact on public health resources (2,3). From 2002 to 2012, type 1 and type 2 diabetes incidence increased 1.4{\%} and 7.1{\%}, respectively, among U.S. youths (4). To assess recent trends in incidence of diabetes in youths (defined for this report as persons aged {\textless}20 years), researchers analyzed 2002-2015 data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study (SEARCH), a U.S. population-based registry study with clinical sites located in five states. The incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in U.S. youths continued to rise at constant rates throughout this period. Among all youths, the incidence of type 1 diabetes increased from 19.5 per 100,000 in 2002-2003 to 22.3 in 2014-2015 (annual percent change [APC] = 1.9{\%}). Among persons aged 10-19 years, type 2 diabetes incidence increased from 9.0 per 100,000 in 2002-2003 to 13.8 in 2014-2015 (APC = 4.8{\%}). For both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the rates of increase were generally higher among racial/ethnic minority populations than those among whites. These findings highlight the need for continued surveillance for diabetes among youths to monitor overall and group-specific trends, identify factors driving these trends, and inform health care planning.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The question of whether neighborhood environment contributes directly to the development of obesity and diabetes remains unresolved. The study reported on here uses data from a social experiment to assess the association of randomly assigned variation in neighborhood conditions with obesity and diabetes. METHODS: From 1994 through 1998, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) randomly assigned 4498 women with children living in public housing in high-poverty urban census tracts (in which ≥40{\%} of residents had incomes below the federal poverty threshold) to one of three groups: 1788 were assigned to receive housing vouchers, which were redeemable only if they moved to a low-poverty census tract (where {\textless}10{\%} of residents were poor), and counseling on moving; 1312 were assigned to receive unrestricted, traditional vouchers, with no special counseling on moving; and 1398 were assigned to a control group that was offered neither of these opportunities. From 2008 through 2010, as part of a long-term follow-up survey, we measured data indicating health outcomes, including height, weight, and level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). RESULTS: As part of our long-term survey, we obtained data on body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) for 84.2{\%} of participants and data on glycated hemoglobin level for 71.3{\%} of participants. Response rates were similar across randomized groups. The prevalences of a BMI of 35 or more, a BMI of 40 or more, and a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.5{\%} or more were lower in the group receiving the low-poverty vouchers than in the control group, with an absolute difference of 4.61 percentage points (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -8.54 to -0.69), 3.38 percentage points (95{\%} CI, -6.39 to -0.36), and 4.31 percentage points (95{\%} CI, -7.82 to -0.80), respectively. The differences between the group receiving traditional vouchers and the control group were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The opportunity to move from a neighborhood with a high level of poverty to one with a lower level of poverty was associated with modest but potentially important reductions in the prevalence of extreme obesity and diabetes. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear but warrant further investigation, given their potential to guide the design of community-level interventions intended to improve health.

abstract = {Background: The U.S. foreclosure crisis intensified markedly during the Great Recession of 2007-09, and currently an estimated five percent of U.S. residential properties are more than 90 days past due or in the process of foreclosure. Yet there has been no systematic assessment of the effects of foreclosure on health and mental health. Methods and Findings: I applied systematic search terms to PubMed and PsycINFO to identify quantitative or qualitative studies about the relationship between home foreclosure and health or mental health. After screening the titles and abstracts of 930 publications and reviewing the full text of 76 articles, dissertations, and other reports, I identified 42 publications representing 35 unique studies about foreclosure, health, and mental health. The majority of studies (32 [91{\%}]) concluded that foreclosure had adverse effects on health or mental health, while three studies yielded null or mixed findings. Only two studies examined the extent to which foreclosure may have disproportionate impacts on ethnic or racial minority populations. Conclusions: Home foreclosure adversely affects health and mental health through channels operating at multiple levels: at the individual level, the stress of personally experiencing foreclosure was associated with worsened mental health and adverse health behaviors, which were in turn linked to poorer health status; at the community level, increasing degradation of the neighborhood environment had indirect, cross-level adverse effects on health and mental health. Early intervention may be able to prevent acute economic shocks from eventually developing into the chronic stress of foreclosure, with all of the attendant benefits this implies for health and mental health status. Programs designed to encourage early return of foreclosed properties back into productive use may have similar health and mental health benefits.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Homelessness is associated with worse diabetes outcomes, but the relationship between other forms of unstable housing and diabetes is not well studied. We assessed whether unstable housing was associated with increased risk for diabetesrelated emergency department use or hospitalization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey (HCPS), a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of patients who receive care at federally funded safety-net health centers. We included nonhomeless adults (aged ≥18 years) with self-reported diabetes. Unstable housing was defined as not having enough money to pay rent or mortgage, moving two ormore times in the past 12 months, orstaying at a place one does not own or rent. The primary outcome was self-report of diabetes-related emergency department visit or inpatient hospitalization in the last 12 months. We also examined use of housing assistance. RESULTS: Of 1,087 participants, representing 3,277,165 adults with diabetes, 37{\%} were unstably housed. Overall, 13.7{\%} of participants reported a diabetes-related emergency department visit or hospitalization in the past year. In logistic regression analyses adjusted for multiple potential confounders, unstable housing was associated with greater odds of diabetes-related emergency department use or hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio 5.17 [95{\%} CI2.08-12.87]). Only 0.9{\%} ofunstably housed individuals reported receiving help with housing through their clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Unstable housing is common and associated with increased risk of diabetes-related emergency department and inpatient use. Addressing unstable housing in clinical settings may help improve health care utilization for vulnerable individuals with diabetes.},

abstract = {Lack of affordable housing access represents a significant and growing problem for low-income households in the United States and these housing challenges may present barriers to the management of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. In this qualitative study, we examined how both housing challenges and housing resources shaped diabetes self-management behaviors. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 low-income residents of one US city, New Haven, Connecticut, who had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and either resided in or qualified for subsidized housing. We purposively constructed our sample to include a range of housing experiences (subsidized, unsubsidized, homeless) and treatment regimes. We analyzed the data using grounded theory techniques of inductive coding and memo writing. Our findings suggest multiple ways that housing access can affect diabetes self-management with implications for blood glucose levels and future complications. Specifically, we describe the ways that housing access affected participants' ability to: 1) prioritize their diabetes care, 2) establish and maintain diabetes routines, and 3) afford diabetes-related expenses. Together, our findings show how housing challenges increased the cost of adherence to diabetes management regimes such that inadequately housed individuals had to both invest and sacrifice more for the same outcomes. Our findings suggest that improved affordable housing access may represent an opportunity to improve outcomes and reduce socioeconomic disparities among those living with type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the process of implementing a diabetes prevention program provided by homecare nurses to residents of public housing communities. Design and Sample: A cluster randomization pilot study was conducted comparing enhanced standard care (2 interactive classes on diabetes prevention) to a diabetes prevention program (7 interactive classes and behavioral support). The sample (n = 67) was primarily female (79{\%}), nonwhite (76{\%}), unpartnered (83{\%}), with a mean age of 40 years, and an average of 3 children. Mixed methods were used to evaluate the implementation process. Measures: Data were collected on attendance, attrition, and protocol implementation. Interviews were conducted with nurses and community health workers who assisted with program implementation. Results: Home-care nurses were able to implement a diabetes prevention program in public housing communities, with a protocol implementation of 83{\%} across classes and groups. Attendance was suboptimal with 60{\%} for the enhanced standard care group and 54{\%} for the diabetes prevention group. Nurses and community health workers were resourceful and positive about program implementation. Conclusion: Linking existing resources, such as a homecare agency with a public housing community, is one approach to disseminate diabetes prevention programs.},
