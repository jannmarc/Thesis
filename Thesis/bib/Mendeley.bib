abstract = {Lack of affordable housing access represents a significant and growing problem for low-income households in the United States and these housing challenges may present barriers to the management of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. In this qualitative study, we examined how both housing challenges and housing resources shaped diabetes self-management behaviors. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 low-income residents of one US city, New Haven, Connecticut, who had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and either resided in or qualified for subsidized housing. We purposively constructed our sample to include a range of housing experiences (subsidized, unsubsidized, homeless) and treatment regimes. We analyzed the data using grounded theory techniques of inductive coding and memo writing. Our findings suggest multiple ways that housing access can affect diabetes self-management with implications for blood glucose levels and future complications. Specifically, we describe the ways that housing access affected participants' ability to: 1) prioritize their diabetes care, 2) establish and maintain diabetes routines, and 3) afford diabetes-related expenses. Together, our findings show how housing challenges increased the cost of adherence to diabetes management regimes such that inadequately housed individuals had to both invest and sacrifice more for the same outcomes. Our findings suggest that improved affordable housing access may represent an opportunity to improve outcomes and reduce socioeconomic disparities among those living with type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the process of implementing a diabetes prevention program provided by homecare nurses to residents of public housing communities. Design and Sample: A cluster randomization pilot study was conducted comparing enhanced standard care (2 interactive classes on diabetes prevention) to a diabetes prevention program (7 interactive classes and behavioral support). The sample (n = 67) was primarily female (79{\%}), nonwhite (76{\%}), unpartnered (83{\%}), with a mean age of 40 years, and an average of 3 children. Mixed methods were used to evaluate the implementation process. Measures: Data were collected on attendance, attrition, and protocol implementation. Interviews were conducted with nurses and community health workers who assisted with program implementation. Results: Home-care nurses were able to implement a diabetes prevention program in public housing communities, with a protocol implementation of 83{\%} across classes and groups. Attendance was suboptimal with 60{\%} for the enhanced standard care group and 54{\%} for the diabetes prevention group. Nurses and community health workers were resourceful and positive about program implementation. Conclusion: Linking existing resources, such as a homecare agency with a public housing community, is one approach to disseminate diabetes prevention programs.},
