## Study Setting and Study Design

The current study investigates whether public housing is asociated with risk of diabetes status among King County, WA residents who were enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. This study uses a descriptive cross-sectional design. The cross-sectional design is appropriate because it allows for an estimate of a dichotomous disease outcome at a particular point in time [@greenland].

The analysis of this study was conducted on a dataset compiled from the King County _Data Across Sectors for Housing and Health (DASHH)_ partnership. The findings from the original initial study have previously been reported [@PublicHealth-SeattleandKingCounty2018].

## Data Sources

In an effort to reduce fragmented data siloes across different sectors, the DASHH partnership was formed in 2016 between Public Health - Seattle and King County (PHSKC), and two public housing authories, King County Housing Authority (KCHA) and Seattle Housing Authority (SHA). The primary objectives for DASHH were to join health and housing administrative data together to inform and measure future interventions, relating to policy, outreach, and program evaluation that would improve the health of King County residents, as well as to disseminate actionable data with key health and housing stakeholders.

The housing data provided by both KCHA and SHA originated from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This data source contained elements that included demographic information and period of enrollment for families and individuals. Claims and enrollment for Medicaid and Medicare data were from Washington Health Care Authority (HCA) which was provided to PHSKC. Enrollment data contained information on who was recieving Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Claims data provided elements such as diagnosis codes that were used to identify acute events and chronic conditions. All these data sources were linked together by a unique identifier ID.

## Study Population

The study population were participants that were enrolled in either Medicare or Medicaid programs. Further eligibility for study participation included King County, Washington residency and at least 11 months of Medicare or Medicaid coverage in 2017. The overall number of participants derived from the DASHH dataset totaled 585,372.

### Exposure Variable

The exposure variable for this study was public housing authority (PHA) status. This was extracted from the HUD-50058 form which was provided by the PHAs. The HUD-50058 form provides information on families that participate in public housing or Section 8 rental subsidy programs [Source]. Housing assitance is separated into 3 main types:
* Housing Choice Vouchers - vouchers provided to recipients to rent units on the private housing market
* Public housing properties and units - subisidized housing managed by PHAs
* Project-based vouchers - subsidized housing units not managed by PHAs

Responses on the HUD-50058 form were combined into a composite public housing binary variable. Study partipants that were not enrolled in any of the listed housing assistance programs were coded as 0 for PHA status. Whereas, those responses that contained any of the 3 types of housing housing assistance was given a 1 for PHA status.

### Outcome Variable

The outcome variable for this study was diabetes status. Diabetes status was defined using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chonic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) algorithm. Diabetes status is defined as having at least 1 inpatient, skill nursing facility, home health agency or 2 hospital outpatient or carrier claims with diabetes diagnoses codes as outlined by the chronic conditions reference list within the last 2 years. This definition does not specify diabetes variant but instead accounts for any diabetes diagnoses. The outcome variable was also dichotomous. Those that had did not meet the CCW alogrithm were coded a 0 and those that were coded as 1 for diabetes status.
