## Study Setting and Study Design
The current study investigates whether public housing is asociated with risk of diabetes status among King County, WA residents who were enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. This study uses a descriptive cross-sectional design. The cross-sectional design is appropriate because it allows for an estimate of a dichotomous disease outcome at a particular point in time [@greenland1988].

The analysis of this study was conducted on a dataset compiled from the King County _Data Across Sectors for Housing and Health (DASHH)_ partnership. The findings from the original initial study have previously been reported [@PublicHealth-SeattleandKingCounty2018].

## Data Sources
In an effort to reduce fragmented data siloes across different sectors, the DASHH partnership was formed in 2016 between Public Health - Seattle and King County , and two public housing authories, King County Housing Authority and Seattle Housing Authority . The primary objectives for DASHH were to join health and housing administrative data together to inform and measure future interventions, relating to policy, outreach, and program evaluation that would improve the health of King County residents, as well as to disseminate actionable data with key health and housing stakeholders.

The housing data provided by both KCHA and SHA originated from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This data source contained elements that included demographic information and period of enrollment for families and individuals. Claims and enrollment for Medicaid and Medicare data were from Washington Health Care Authority (HCA) which was provided to PHSKC. Enrollment data contained information on who was recieving Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Claims data provided elements such as diagnosis codes that were used to identify acute events and chronic conditions. All these data sources were linked together by a unique identifier ID.

## Study Population
The study population were participants that were enrolled in either Medicare or Medicaid programs. Further eligibility for study participation included King County, Washington residency and at least 11 months of Medicare or Medicaid coverage in 2017. The overall number of participants derived from the DASHH dataset totaled 585,372.

### Exposure Variable
The exposure variable for this study was public housing assistance status. This was extracted from the HUD-50058 form which was provided by the PHAs. The HUD-50058 form provides information on families that participate in public housing or Section 8 rental subsidy programs [Source]. Housing assitance is separated into 3 main types:

* Housing Choice Vouchers - vouchers provided to recipients to rent units on the private housing market
* Public housing properties and units - subisidized housing managed by PHAs
* Project-based vouchers - subsidized housing units not managed by PHAs

Responses on the HUD-50058 form were combined into a composite public housing binary variable. Study partipants that were not enrolled in any of the listed housing assistance programs were coded as 0 for PHA status. Whereas, those responses that contained any of the 3 types of housing housing assistance was given a 1 for PHA status.

### Outcome Variable
The outcome variable for this study was diabetes status.This was defined using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chonic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) algorithm [Source]. According to the CCW, a participant meets the criteria if they have at least 1 inpatient, skilled nursing facility, home health agency visit or 2 hospital outpatient or carrier claims with diabetes diagnoses codes as outlined by the chronic conditions reference list within the last 2 years[Source]. This definition does not specify diabetes variant but instead accounts for any type diabetes diagnoses. The diabetes status outcome variable was dichotomous, given a 0 or 1. Those that did not meet the CCW alogrithm were coded a 0 and those that met the criteria were coded as 1 for diabetes status.

### Potenetial Confounders
Potential confounders were identified based on literature review. This study considers age, race and ethnicity and gender as potential confounding variables. Each of these variables were selected due to the increased baseline risk for partipants to be either in public housing or have diabetes. It is known that diabetes is an age-related disease, with a higher risk for older populations [@Selvin2013]. Age was presented as a discrete variable for the partipants age in 2017. Similarly, according to CDC data, racial minority groups may be differentially at risk for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared to their white counterparts [@Divers2020 & @CDC2020]. Race and ethnicity variable was defined categorically and included: American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian, Asian Pacific Islander, Black/African American, Latino, Multiple, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Other, Unknown, and White. Gender was selected because both psychosocial and biological factors are responsible for sex and gender diabetes risk differences [@Kautzky-Willer2016]. Gender was grouped categorically and included: Female, Male, and Multiple.

## Analyses
As is common in epidemiological and health services research, demographic characteristics were presented to describe the population distribition [@hayes-larson2019]. Descriptive analyses were first used to list the  percentages for each of the demographic categorical variables. (See table 1). The demographics table is arranged by PHA status, this included: KCHA, SHA, combined PHA and non-PHA. Although the discrete variable for age was used in the statistical analyses, age was reported categorically in the descriptive analyses for a simpler layout. Mean and median age were also shown for each category.

For the statistical analyses, logistic regression models were fitted to assess the risk of diabetes status in relation to public housing assistance status. This analysis is appropriate for this study because logistic reregression analyses allows for measuring the association of an effect towards a binomial response variable by combining multiple variables to avoid confounding [@Sperandei2014].

Two models were used to determine the odds ratios (OR) and coresponding 95% confidence intervals for the association between public housing assistance and diabetes status. The models used were the unadjusted model, without any other variables included in the analysis and the adjusted model including age, race and ethnicity and gender variables. In addition, models were fit to determine the odds ratio of diabetes status for each of the public housing authority. Similarly, the unadjusted model and the adjusted model that included age, race and ethinicity and gender variables were used to determine the association for the second analysis. Findings were statistical significant if the estimates did not cross the the confidence intervals and p-values were below <0.05 cutoff. Analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.0.
