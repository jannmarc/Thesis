# Background and Significance {#rmd-basics}

## Public Housing

Housing is an important determinant of health[@Krieger2002]. Health outcomes are affected by housing quality, safety, stability and affordability[@Taylor2018]. 

## Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic disease that is characterized by an inability of the body to maintain a healthy blood glucose level, this can cause a variety of symptoms that affect multiple systems in the body and can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The key regulator hormone of glucose is insulin and it is produced in the pancreas. The absence or malfunction of insulin leads to elevated blood glucose levels called hyperglycemia. When insulin hormone is missing or ineffective the disease is called Diabetes Mellitus, this condition has multiple types.

### Diabetes Variants

The most common diabetes variants include type I diabetes mellitus, type II diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes. Type I diabetes is usually caused by genetic factors triggering an autoimmune reaction that results in the destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Also known as Juvenile Diabetes, the type I classification is typically diagnosed relatively early in life during childhood or early adulthood. Whereas, Type II diabetes develops when the body can still produce insulin however the amount is insuffient or when the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin. Type II diabetes is largely attributed to lifestyle factors including obesity and physical activity levels. Gestational diabetes is the least common type and occurs during pregnancy.

Diabetes is a serious chronic disease condition without a medical cure. Medical treatment of Diabetes is centered around exogenous insulin replacement or use of medications that stimulate the pancreas to produce endogenous insulin. In the absence of adequate control, diabetes can lead to increased risk of vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, amputation of toes, feet, or legs and even premature death; all of which have financial implications.

Many families have been left devastated by some of these complications and are financially indebted because of hospital bills, cost of medications, and time off work.  For Type II Diabetics, a big part of their management is lifestyle modification which includes diet control and increased physical activity. This goal of this later method is to promote weight loss and reduce excess fat which in turn reduces insulin resistance and enhances disease control.[@Ludwig2011]
