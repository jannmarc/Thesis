# Background and Significance {#rmd-basics}

## Public Housing

Housing is widely awknowledged as an important social determinant of health[@Thomson2013]. Health outcomes driven by housing are mediated by housing quality, safety, stability and affordability[@Taylor2018]. There have been well established links between housing quality and morbidity from mental disorders, injuries infectious diseases, and chronic diseases[@Krieger2002].

While there is a growing body of evidence associating substandard housing with poor health outcomes, the relationship between public housing and health is minimaly explored. Public housing provides decent and safe rental housing for eligible populations including low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities [@HUD]. Relevant studies have shown that public housing residents have worse health outcomes than other city residents [@digenies-bury2008 and @Mansjurez]. Even less understood is the relationship between subsidized public housing and chronic health conditions like diabetes.

## Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic disease that is characterized by an inability of the body to maintain a healthy blood glucose level, this can cause a variety of symptoms that affect multiple systems in the body and can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The key regulator hormone of glucose is insulin and it is produced in the pancreas. The absence or malfunction of insulin leads to elevated blood glucose levels called hyperglycemia. When insulin hormone is missing or ineffective the disease is called Diabetes Mellitus, this condition has multiple types.

### Diabetes Variants

The most common diabetes variants include type I diabetes mellitus, type II diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes. Type I diabetes is usually caused by genetic factors triggering an autoimmune reaction that results in the destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Also known as Juvenile Diabetes, the type I classification is typically diagnosed relatively early in life during childhood or early adulthood. Whereas, Type II diabetes develops when the body can still produce insulin however the amount is insuffient or when the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin. Type II diabetes is largely attributed to lifestyle factors including obesity and physical activity levels. Gestational diabetes is the least common type and occurs during pregnancy. The prevalance of type II diabetes are much higher than type I. In the US, type II and type I diabetes accounted for approximately 91% and 6% of all diagnosesd diabetes cases [@cdc2016].

Diabetes is a serious chronic disease condition without a medical cure. However treatment for diabetes involves disease prevention and management. Medical treatment of diabetes primarily consists of exogenous insulin replacement or use of medications that stimulate the pancreas to produce endogenous insulin. Without adequate blood control, diabetes can lead to increased risk of other conditions including vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, amputation and even premature death.

##Problem Definition
Disease management for type II diabetics focuses on lifestyle modification such as diet control and increased physical activity. The goal is to promote weight loss and reduce excess fat that subsequently reduces insulin resistance and enhances disease control. Additionally, other determinants of health have been recognized to impact diabetes management, namely healthcare access, cultural and social support, economic stability and built environments [@Clark2014]. Housing instability and food insecurity in particular have been shown to reduce diabetes management self-efficacy in low income adults [@Vijayaraghavan2011].


While there are numerous published literature on the association between substandard housing and chronic conditions like diabetes, there are few studies that examine the relationship between public housing and diabetes. For this reason, the current study aimed to explore this public health issue within a local context in King County, WA. In the effort to decrease the gap of knowledge between the junction of public housing and health, Public Health Seattle and King County (PHSKC) formed a unique partnership with King County Housing Authority (KCHA), Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) enabling data to be shared across sectors with the intention of informing and measuring future interventions that would improve the health of the county residents. This research aims to use the provided data to contribute to the literature on the association between public housing and diabetes among medicaid and medicare patients.
